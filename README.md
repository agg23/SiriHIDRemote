## Features
* Recognizes Remote Buttons
* Remote Visualizer

## In Progress
* Touchpad Support
* Microphone Support
* Customizable Preset Actions in Response to Button Presses
* More Robust Connection Handling

## Usage
SiriHIDRemote currently contains a hardcoded remote identifier that corresponds to my remote (DL5QD2HMGQQT).  In order to be used with another remote, this line must be changed to your device identifier, which can be found when connecting to your Mac.  This requirement should be removed in the future

SiriHIDRemote relies on [HIDKit](https://github.com/shiroholloway/HIDKit)
